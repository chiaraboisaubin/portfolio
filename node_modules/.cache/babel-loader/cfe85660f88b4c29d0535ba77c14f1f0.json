I believe these were indirect competitors because of some of the features they have accessible for finding an artist, how they displayed posts, the ability to communicate with an artist, and the parts that allow people to understand the tattoo culture.  By identifying the underserved opportunities in the market, I could list possible solutions to fill the users' needs.\n                                                        This is an application that I have been assisting.
