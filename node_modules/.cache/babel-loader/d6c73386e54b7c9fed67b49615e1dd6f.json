Also, look at tattoo shops and tattoo artist websites to find a common theme. Through my research, I've discovered Tattoodo AND Tattoomap that were indirect competitors for Ink Tank. I believe these were indirect competitors because of some of the features they have accessible for finding an artist, how they displayed posts, the ability to communicate with an artist, and the parts that allow people to understand the tattoo culture.  By identifying the underserved opportunities in the market, I could list possible solutions to fill the users' needs.\n</article>\n                                                <img className=\"img-1\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/yqrcc4p/competivie-analsyis-inktank.png\" alt=\"competivie-analsyis-inktank\" border=\"0\"></img>\n                                                </div> \n                                               <img className=\"img-2\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/D8GX2KS/S-W-O-T.png\" alt=\"S-W-O-T\" border=\"0\" />\n\n                                                <h3>What did we learn about potential users? </h3>\n                                                <div className=\"flex-init\">\n                                                        <article>To understand what our potential users need and solve the problems that are noticed from the competitor analysis.
