Looking for a tattoo design and finding a capable tattoo artist feels like a loop,\n                                                        jump, and tumble. One must direct message or email, send documents of what you want to do,\n                                                        then go to another app to make an appointment, and if the artist allows you to pay digitally --\n                                                        you have to go through another app to make a deposit payment.\n                                                        What I mean to say about this process is there are many steps to accomplish.\n                                                        That is about five to seven steps a user will have to and in different methods.\n                                                        At least that was my experience with three of my tattoos.\n                                                </article>\n\n                                                <i className=\"bold\">A user needs to discover various tattoos for inspiration and find a capable artist to produce their design.

Initially, the goal was to go to some tattoo shops and observe an artist during the day and see their habits. Even though I was unable to observe and interview professional tattoo artists, it allowed me to focus on the client-side of the app.\n                                                </article>\n\n                                                <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DfBD0w9/survey-overview.png\" alt=\"survey-overview\" border=\"0\" />\n\n                                                <span> More detail about the\n                                                <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cX6eLaoTXFv7hxXp3U853cmrGd-WuHqp/view?usp=sharing\"> User survey and interviews overview</a>\n                                                </span>\n                                        </div>\n\n                                          {/*  POINT OF VIEW */}\n\n                                        <div className=\"layout-container-l66\">\n                                                <h2 className=\"project-titles\">POV</h2>\n\n\n                                                <article>\n                                                        From the data provided from understanding the user, I built a couple of personas, William and Danielle.\n                                                        To show how Ink Tank benedicts user’s day-to-day lives, I offered scenarios.\n                                                </article>\n                                                <div className=\"flex-init\">\n                                                        <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/5vrs0yV/Danielle.png\" alt=\"Danielle\" border=\"0\" />\n                                                        <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/XD8GypT/William.png\" alt=\"William\" border=\"0\" />\n                                                </div>\n\n\n                                                <span> More detail about the\n                                                <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19qxU0cJqSae26r6FoW5kZHjDe9RS2WBt/view?usp=sharing\"> user stories,</a>\n                                                        <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lkw71WvpuNFEuvDgIsTW20qh8mp7DmV2/view?usp=sharing\"> user flow, </a> and\n                                                <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\" After creating personas I built a sitemap and conducted card sorting.

Once I felt satisfied with what was on paper turned the design into a high-fidelity prototype and tested it again with some users.\n                                                </article>\n                                                <article>\n                                                        Finally able to do the fun part, prototyping! When I was styling the high-fidelity prototype, I had a challenge picking the colors. I knew I wanted to go with an orange-red color to translate creativity. I was able to find a shade that is not only WGAG AA friendly but met my expectations.  I want to improve the vector images; they look simple and do not connect with the style of the app as much as I want.\n\n                                                </article>\n\n                                        {/*  TESTING  */}\n                                                <h2 className=\"project-titles\">Testing </h2>\n                                                <article> With the testing for time purposes, I conduct a usability test and preference testing simultaneously.  </article>\n                                                <article>For this usability test, I only use video chats on Zoom and Skype.

There were some technical issues, like a person's internet was slow and a page took longer to load, problems with the video recording,\n                                                           or the video platform stopped working. I adjusted the script to make it sound less robotic and cleared up some of the tasks for task two. I made the user found an image they liked and booked a session with that artist. Some of the tester's comments were similar, but the experience was completely different. Some users could do the task faster than others; they did not notice a feature or provided me a lot of information.\n                                                         It was great to hear people interested in getting a tattoo but have not had the experience of getting a tattoo and wanting more steps for the process.   </article>\n\n                                                        <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jVbj3PB/usuability-1.png\" alt=\"usuability-1\" border=\"0\"/>\n                                                        <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/XVBmdjt/usuability-3.png\" alt=\"usuability-3\" border=\"0\"/>\n                                                        <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/hRkSCvQ/usuability-4.png\" alt=\"usuability-4\" border=\"0\"/>\n\n                                                      <article>\n                                                      I wanted to see if the user can navigate building a project, finding an artist, and booking an appointment with the usability testing.
