To do so, a user needs a place where people can publish pieces of a tattoo design, categorize the tattoo style, and connect the artist who did the work, encouraging people to interact.</i>\n                                                <article>\n                                                        For this project, I wanted to compress the process into one space.\n                                                        Ink Tank aims to share and find tattoo inspirations and find artists who can design,\n                                                        organize assignments, and organize appointments.\n                                                </article>\n                                        </div>\n\n                                        <div className=\"layout-container-l4\">\n                                                <h2 className=\"project-titles\"> Process </h2>\n                                                <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/2W9yCGV/Design-Thinking-Process.png\" alt=\"Design-Thinking-Process\" border=\"0\"/>\n                                        </div>\n\n                                        {/*  UNDERSTAND */}\n                                        <div className=\"layout-container-l5\">\n                                                <h2 className=\"project-titles\"> Understand  </h2>\n                                                <div className=\"flex-init\">\n                                                        <article>\n                                                                I research mobile apps that focus on sharing and displaying content,\n                                                                organizing communication, and scheduling an appointment for the tattoo industry.\n                                                                Conducting a competitive analysis allows me to see what is out there for people,\n                                                                how easy it is for people who have experience getting a tattoo and are entirely new to the process.\n                                                                Tattoodo and Tattoomap were indirect competitors for Ink Tank.\n                                                                Those sites were the best indirect competitors due to some features accessible for finding an artist,\n                                                                displaying a post, communicating with another user, and visual proof on licensed tattoo artist compare to a regular user.\n                                                                By identifying the underserved opportunities in the market,\n                                                                I made possible solutions to fill the users' needs.\n                                                        </article>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <img className=\"img-1\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/yqrcc4p/competivie-analsyis-inktank.png\" alt=\"competivie-analsyis-inktank\" border=\"0\"></img>\n                                                <img className=\"img-2\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/D8GX2KS/S-W-O-T.png\" alt=\"S-W-O-T\" border=\"0\" />\n\n                                                <span> More detail about the\n                                                <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZhoqM_efQ_fDiWyeLxnpw-h6jNTTKkL/view?usp=sharing\"> Competitive and UX analysis</a>\n                                                </span>\n                                        </div>\n                                        {/*  OBSERVE */}\n                                        <div className=\"layout-container-l6\">\n                                                <h2 className=\"project-titles\">Observe</h2>\n\n\n                                                <article>\n                                                        I sent out user surveys and User Interviews; I understand how people organize their projects.\n                                                        The user’s preference enjoys setting up an appointment, looking up ideas, and hiring a professional.\n                                                        I interviewed five users that fit close to the market Ink Tank is reaching.

Initially, the goal was to go to some tattoo shops and observe an artist during the day and see their habits. Even though I was unable to observe and interview professional tattoo artists, it allowed me to focus on the client-side of the app.\n                                                </article>\n\n                                                <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DfBD0w9/survey-overview.png\" alt=\"survey-overview\" border=\"0\" />\n\n                                                <span> More detail about the\n                                                <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cX6eLaoTXFv7hxXp3U853cmrGd-WuHqp/view?usp=sharing\"> User survey and interviews overview</a>\n                                                </span>\n                                        </div>\n\n                                          {/*  POINT OF VIEW */}\n\n                                        <div className=\"layout-container-l66\">\n                                                <h2 className=\"project-titles\">POV</h2>\n\n\n                                                <article>\n                                                        From the data provided from understanding the user, I built a couple of personas, William and Danielle.\n                                                        To show how Ink Tank benedicts user’s day-to-day lives, I offered scenarios.\n                                                </article>\n                                                <div className=\"flex-init\">\n                                                        <img className=\"img-1\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/5vrs0yV/Danielle.png\" alt=\"Danielle\" border=\"0\" />\n                                                        <img className=\"img-1\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/XD8GypT/William.png\" alt=\"William\" border=\"0\" />\n                                                </div>\n                                                                                                \n                                                <article>From the data provided from understanding the user,\n                                                        I built a couple of personas, William and Danielle.\n                                                        I am making the scenarios to show how Ink Tank can benedict users day-to-day lives.\n                                                        Now that there is a better understanding of the users,\n                                                       I created a user flow that shows how a person navigates throughout the app.</article>\n                                     \n                                                     \n                                                                 <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/j51HQgt/userflow2.png\" alt=\"userflow2\" border=\"0\"/>\n\n                                                <span> More detail about the\n                                                <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19qxU0cJqSae26r6FoW5kZHjDe9RS2WBt/view?usp=sharing\"> user stories,</a>\n                                                        <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lkw71WvpuNFEuvDgIsTW20qh8mp7DmV2/view?usp=sharing\"> user flow, </a> and\n                                                <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\" After creating personas I built a sitemap and conducted card sorting.

When I was styling the high-fidelity prototype, I had a challenge picking the colors. I knew I wanted to go with an orange-red color to translate creativity. I was able to find a shade that is not only WGAG AA friendly but met my expectations.  I want to improve the vector images; they look simple and do not connect with the style of the app as much as I want.\n                                                </article>\n                                                <span> More detail about the\n                                                <a className=\"left\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPx6MqRTKEZrDA7NQkoh1xCtQjKzg1i1/view?usp=sharing\"> Low to high fidelity prototyping </a>\n\n                                                </span>\n                                                \n\n                                        {/*  TESTING  */}\n                                                <h2 className=\"project-titles\">Testing </h2>\n                                                <article> With the testing for time purposes, I conduct a usability test and preference testing simultaneously.  </article>\n                                                <article>For this usability test, I only use video chats on Zoom and Skype. The users had the choice to use their laptop or mobile device to play with the prototype. \n                                                         I have to consistently remind the users that the prototype was limited to the interaction for all the sessions. There was one button that did not work.\n                                                          Some of the content was not clear about the page's objective, or it was oddly phrased. There were some technical issues, like a person's internet was slow and a page took longer to load, problems with the video recording,\n                                                           or the video platform stopped working. I adjusted the script to make it sound less robotic and cleared up some of the tasks for task two. I made the user found an image they liked and booked a session with that artist. Some of the tester's comments were similar, but the experience was completely different. Some users could do the task faster than others; they did not notice a feature or provided me a lot of information.\n                                                         It was great to hear people interested in getting a tattoo but have not had the experience of getting a tattoo and wanting more steps for the process.   </article>\n                                                         <h3 className=\"margin-t\">Usability test interviews\tnotes </h3>\n                                                         <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/s2gK7zc/usuability1.png\" alt=\"usuability1\" border=\"0\"/>\n                                                         <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/xH8r571/usuability2.png\" alt=\"usuability2\" border=\"0\"/>\n                                                         <h3 className=\"margin-t\">Sorting notes </h3>\n                                                        <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/k3FSxS0/4-6-Rainbow-Spread-Sheet-Usability-Testing-Ink-Tank-Usability-Test-Results.png\" alt=\"4-6-Rainbow-Spread-Sheet-Usability-Testing-Ink-Tank-Usability-Test-Results\" border=\"0\" />\n\n                                                        \n                                                        \n\n                                                      <article>\n                                                      I wanted to see if the user can navigate building a project, finding an artist, and booking an appointment with the usability testing.
