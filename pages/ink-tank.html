           <h2> Ideation: Thinking about the layout </h2>
               <p>  I created the sitemap with the user flow. To update the sitemap from a user perspective, I decided to do
                card sorting to see what users think where content will be organized. It was interesting to see the
                diverse mindset when it comes to going to specific pages and content.
 </p>
                <p>
                    After sketching a low-fidelity prototype, I tested it out with a couple of users to see if the flow
                    was clear enough for them to get to the features. I analyze the feedback and update the sketch and
                    flow from the majority of call-outs. Once I felt satisfied with what was on paper turned the design
                    into a high-fidelity prototype and tested it again with some users.
                </p>
                <h3> Low-fidelity prototype </h3>

                <p>Finally able to do the fun part, prototyping! When I was styling the high-fidelity prototype, I
                    had a challenge picking the colors. I knew I wanted to go with an orange-red color to translate
                    creativity. I was able to find a shade that is not only WGAG AA friendly but met my expectations. I
                    want to improve the vector images; they look simple and do not connect with the style of the app as
                    much as I want.
                </p>

                <h2> Testing </h2>
                <p>With the testing for time purposes, I conduct a usability test and preference testing
                    simultaneously.
                </p>
                <!-- <article>For this usability test, I only use video chats on Zoom and Skype. The users had the choice to
                    use their laptop or mobile device to play with the prototype. I have to consistently remind the
                    users that the prototype was limited to the interaction for all the sessions. There was one button
                    that did not work. Some of the content was not clear about the page's objective, or it was oddly
                    phrased. There were some technical issues, like a person's internet was slow and a page took longer
                    to load, problems with the video recording, or the video platform stopped working. I adjusted the
                    script to make it sound less robotic and cleared up some of the tasks for task two. I made the user
                    found an image they liked and booked a session with that artist. Some of the tester's comments were
                    similar, but the experience was completely different. Some users could do the task faster than
                    others; they did not notice a feature or provided me a lot of information. It was great to hear
                    people interested in getting a tattoo but have not had the experience of getting a tattoo and
                    wanting more steps for the process.
                </article> -->
                <p>
                    I wanted to see if the user can navigate building a project, finding an artist, and booking an
                    appointment with the usability testing. For the preference test A/B Testing, I tested out the style
                    of buttons.

                </article>
                <img class="background-color-one" src="https://i.ibb.co/hRkSCvQ/usuability-4.png" alt="usuability-4" border="0">
                <p>
                    From the data that I've collected from the testing, I've adjusted the errors on the prototype. Some
                    of
                    the changes were pretty easy to change because they were styling issues, but the one feature was a
                    challenge clarifying scheduling a session.

                        <h2> Handoff</h2>
                        <p>  For the developers, I did provide the following infromation in the Figma file:
                           </p>
                           <ul class="cute-bullets">
                            <li> Components and elements </li>
                            <li> Clickable prototypes </li>
                            <li> Interaction notes </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                <h2> Takeaways </h2>
                <p>
                    As a designer, I wanted to figure out the best way for different components to function and support
                    the app's various features. I wanted to make sure that the elements had a flow that the users can
                    recognize and navigate as much as possible with no assistance or confusion—building a layout that
                    focuses on showing photos and building a project or doing a project in the same area.
