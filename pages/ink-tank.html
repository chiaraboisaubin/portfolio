                Context 
This project aimed to help new customers find a tattoo style or artist with the ability to schedule a session.  
Ink Tank is a web application that allows tattoo lovers to look for tattoos, share their tattoos,
schedule sessions or consultations with a tattoo designer, or develop a project for a new tattoo.
This project was from a UX project with Career Foundry.

                <p>
                    I research mobile apps that focus on sharing and displaying content, organizing communication, and
                    scheduling an appointment for the tattoo industry. Conducting a competitive analysis allows me to
                    see what is out there for people, how easy it is for people who have experience getting a tattoo and
                    are entirely new to the process. Tattoodo and Tattoomap were indirect competitors for Ink Tank.
                    Those sites were the best indirect competitors due to some features accessible for finding an
                    artist, displaying a post, communicating with another user, and visual proof on licensed tattoo
                    artist compare to a regular user. By identifying the underserved opportunities in the market, I made
                    possible solutions to fill the users' needs.

                <h3>Survey</h3>

                <p>
                    I sent out user surveys and user interviews; I understand how people organize their projects. The user prefers setting an appointment, looking up ideas, and hiring a professional. I interviewed five users close to the market Ink Tank is reaching. With the data I analyzed, I learned that users want a place where they can communicate during the build of a design and view profiles and pieces of work. I have built personas for the ideal user and scenarios with the interview and survey information. Creating the personas and scenarios will show the user’s perspective on how Ink Tank will function within their life.
                    I had difficulty finding a tattoo artist willing to talk to me about the tools and methods they use to promote their work and organize appointments and payments. Initially, the goal was to go to some tattoo shops, observe an artist during the day, and see their habits. Even though I could not observe and interview professional tattoo artists, it allowed me to focus on the client side of the app.

                <h2> Ideate </h2>
                I created the sitemap with the user flow. To update the sitemap from a user perspective, I decided to do
                card sorting to see what users think where content will be organized. It was interesting to see the
                diverse mindset when it comes to going to specific pages and content.
 
                <article>
                    After sketching a low-fidelity prototype, I tested it out with a couple of users to see if the flow
                    was clear enough for them to get to the features. I analyze the feedback and update the sketch and
                    flow from the majority of call-outs. Once I felt satisfied with what was on paper turned the design
                    into a high-fidelity prototype and tested it again with some users.

                    had a challenge picking the colors. I knew I wanted to go with an orange-red color to translate
                    creativity. I was able to find a shade that is not only WGAG AA friendly but met my expectations. I
                    want to improve the vector images; they look simple and do not connect with the style of the app as
                    much as I want.

                <h2> Testing </h2>
                <article>With the testing for time purposes, I conduct a usability test and preference testing
                    simultaneously.
                </article>
                <!-- <article>For this usability test, I only use video chats on Zoom and Skype. The users had the choice to
                    use their laptop or mobile device to play with the prototype. I have to consistently remind the
                    users that the prototype was limited to the interaction for all the sessions. There was one button
                    that did not work. Some of the content was not clear about the page's objective, or it was oddly
                    phrased. There were some technical issues, like a person's internet was slow and a page took longer
                    to load, problems with the video recording, or the video platform stopped working. I adjusted the
                    script to make it sound less robotic and cleared up some of the tasks for task two. I made the user
                    found an image they liked and booked a session with that artist. Some of the tester's comments were
                    similar, but the experience was completely different. Some users could do the task faster than
                    others; they did not notice a feature or provided me a lot of information. It was great to hear
                    people interested in getting a tattoo but have not had the experience of getting a tattoo and
                    wanting more steps for the process.
                </article> -->
                <article>
                    I wanted to see if the user can navigate building a project, finding an artist, and booking an
                    appointment with the usability testing. For the preference test A/B Testing, I tested out the style
                    of buttons.

                <article>
                    From the data that I've collected from the testing, I've adjusted the errors on the prototype. Some
                    of
                    the changes were pretty easy to change because they were styling issues, but the one feature was a
                    challenge clarifying scheduling a session.

                    As a designer, I wanted to figure out the best way for different components to function and support
                    the app's various features. I wanted to make sure that the elements had a flow that the users can
                    recognize and navigate as much as possible with no assistance or confusion—building a layout that
                    focuses on showing photos and building a project or doing a project in the same area.
