Having a membership is a way for people to get the benefits of being significant but also want to have the flexibility to use it. The Carepass membership page was where people needed help to get that VIP experience. The membership team worked on this project to build an adjustable, responsive, and customizable user experience.  </p>

                                Baymard provided feedback on the CVS shopping experience that would help connect the UX
                                e-commerce experience. Some of their callouts were to make sure that we have the ability
                                for users to go back to the main page of content if they were navigating to another page
                                and have information flow. Looking at the current membership of Carepass, we noticed
                                that getting to the dashboard page was not as accessible. The content was misleading or
                                not as clear and repetitive content on the same page.

                        <p>
                            We decided to conduct user testing with the recent experience to see if the information made
                            sense to users and if participants could navigate to the dashboard and certain features like
                            updating their membership. I did competitive research on what other companies did for their
                            membership or dashboard pages.
                        </p>
                        The companies looked into were:

                <h2>User testing</h2>
                <p>
                    We interviewed <b> 5 </b> participants who were current Carepass members and had done user testing
                    in the
                    past. We also looked for users who had a type of disability that they needed technical assistance.
                </p>

                <h3> Our goals: </h3>
                <ul class="cute-bullets">
                    <li> See their expectations regarding the dashboard </li>
                    <li> Gather their thoughts on the current information about Carepass on
                        the page.</li>
                    <li> If the participants could navigate to the dashboard page</li>
                </ul>

                <h3> With the data collected from the testing, we learned the following: </h3>

                <ol class="cute-bullets">
                    <li> <b> 3 </b> out of 5 participants suggested reorganizing the content and the information that
                        needed
                        clarification.</li>
                    <li> <b> 2 </b> participants thought that the cancelation call to action should be more visible.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b> 2 </b> participants users said there was significant white space on the page. </li>
                    <li> <b> All </b> participants identify seeing membership information as the top 3 important to
                        them.</li>
                    <li> <b> All </b> participants responded that they were satisfied with the current. Dashboard
                        content. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Even though we conducted user testing and user interviews, we used the CVS persona Micheal to
                    sync up with CVS to ensure we were going with other users' goals.
                </p>

                <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <p>
                    With the information gathered and syncing with the CVS persona, other designers and I worked
                    together to see how to make the information flow and not repeat information. The wireframe was also
                    where we ensured that people who were a part of the project and other teams aligned on how to
                    present to the information. on how data would be presented.

                        additional information, we needed the following experiences:

                    Once we agreed on how we wanted the information, I started working on the user interface. I made
                    sure that we were designing mobile-first, responsive design, implementing the CVS UI kit and
                    components, and staying as close as possible to the Carepass brand. Mobile was less challenging than
                    desktop, and there was some disagreement of the style for simplicity but ensuring that there was the
                    ability to add more programs and features to the page. We also had to deal with accessibility calls
                    out.

                        and developers
                        could plan building.
                    </p>
                    For the developers, I did provide the following information in the Figma file:
                    <ul class="cute-bullets">
                        <li> A11Y markups </li>
                        <li> Components and elements </li>
                        <li> Clickable prototypes </li>
                        <li> Interaction notes </li>
                        <li> List of Components, existing elements, and new elements </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2> Takeaways </h2>
                <h3> Did we answer our questions? </h3>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of challenges with this project, like Figma being new to the team, a lot of
                    different departments and people's feedback that needed to stay with the project's goals, and the
                    tight deadline. I believe we achieved the goals of simplicity, ensuring we do the best accessible
                    design practices and the ability to add information in the future.
                </p>


                <h3> Next steps? </h3>

                    <li> Collect the data from the A/B Test </li>
                    <li> Do another user test with the updated pages </li>
