                <article>
                    The project is to update the Carepass membership profile page and slowly add a space allowing users
                    to access others' programs.
                </article>
                <h2>Initial goal </h2>
                <article>
                    The goal of the business was to increase visits on the dashboard, reduce the amount of customer
                    service calls that we sync the user interfaces membership page, and minimize the cancelation of
                    membership. The design goals were to make the information easy to find on the membership page,
                    organize the content, and sync the user interface with the new CVS UI kit and components while
                    staying as close as possible to Carepass's current brand style and practice responsive and
                    mobile-first design.

                    <h2>Competitive and UX analysis</h2>
                    <article>
                        I did competitive research on what other companies did for their membership or dashboard pages.
                        The companies looked into were Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Adobe. I noticed the information was
                        two pages with all the data. The cancel call to action was visible; they used certain
                        information. Most profiles and memberships did have a hierarchy of information. Their style was
                        simple, and they were able to add new containers. The content was a hierarchy of information
                        about the membership. I also looked at how the companies showed how they organized multiple
                        programs.

                        Baymard provided feedback on the CVS shopping experience that would help connect the UX
                        e-commerce experience. Some of their callouts were to make sure that we have the ability for
                        users to go back to the main page of content if they were navigated to another page and have
                        information have some flow.

                        Looking at the current membership of Carepass, we noticed that getting to the dashboard page was
                        not as accessible. The content was misleading or not as clear and repetitive content on the same
                        page.

                <h2>User testing</h2>
                <article>
                    We worked with the research team to conduct moderate user testing with the existing page. We
                    interviewed five participants who were current Carepass members and had done user testing in the
                    past. We also looked for users who had a type of disability that they needed technical assistance.
                    Our goals were to see their expectations regarding the dashboard, see if the participants could
                    navigate to the dashboard page, and see their thoughts on the current information about Carepass on
                    the page.
                    With the data that was collected from the testing, we learned the following:
                </article>
                <ol>
                    <li> 3 out of 5 participants suggested reorganizing the content and the information that needed
                        clarification.</li>
                    <li> 2 participants thought that the cancelation call to action should be more visible. </li>
                    <li> 2 participants users said there was significant white space on the page. </li>
                    <li> All participants identify seeing membership information as the top 3 important to them.</li>
                    <li> All participants responded that they were satisfied with the current. Dashboard content. </li>
                </ol>
                <article> Even though we conducted user testing and user interviews, we used the CVS persona Micheal to
                    sync up with CVS to ensure we were going with other users' goals. </article>

                <h2>Wireframe and Final mockup</h2>
                <article>
                    With the information that was gathered from the user testing, the goals of all specialties, and the
                    CVS persona that already existed, me and other designers worked together to see how to make the
                    information flow and not repeat information. The wireframe was also the space where we ensured that
                    people who were a part of the project and other teams were aligned on how data would be presented.

                    At this time, Carepass was also introducing a new feature for gaining rewards with the amount of
                    steps a users take. Leadership wanted to make the feature apart of the dashboard. We that additional
                    information we needed the following experiences: New user, existing user with or without the reward
                    healthy behavior and showing avaible monthly free $10 or the next monthly free $10, so about eight
                    user scenarios.

                    Once we agreed on how we wanted the information, I started working on the user interface. I made
                    sure that we were designing mobile-first, responsive design, implementing the CVS UI kit and
                    components, and staying as close as possible to the Carepass brand. Mobile was less challenging than
                    desktop, and there was some disagreement of the style for simplicity but ensuring that there was the
                    ability to add more programs and features to the page. We also had to deal with accessibility calls
                    out.

                    I was the only person at the time who knew how to use Figma, I connected most of the existing
                    components to the UI kit, and build a prototype for the web experience.
                </article>
                <h2> Overview </h2>
                <article>
                    The discussion and handoff were broken down by feature container so leadership and developers could
                    look at each and make their development plan for building.
                    There were a lot of challenges with this project like Figma was new to the team, a lot of different
                    departments and people feedback that needed to stay with the project's goals, and the tight
                    deadline. I believe we did achieve the goals of simplicity, making sure that we do best accessible
                    and design practices and the ability to add information in the future. The following steps were to
                    do an A/B testing with the saving container, update ways to navigate, and look for ways to improve
                    the app experience.
