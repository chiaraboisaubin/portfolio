                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Chowdown was a web-based application I was building with at MakeSense. This web app was a
                    reservation for dining in a restaurant that allows people to pre-order and pay separately. There was
                    also a feature that would enable servers to know a user’s food allergies/dietary requirements in
                    advance. The projects I focused on were the group payment methods, onboarding a new user who wanted
                    to make a reservation, and organizing reservations on the restaurant side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When dining out with friends or colleagues, some of these events may occur: someone wants to order
                    in advice because of time, and there is no menu online, the hassle of spitting the bill as a group
                    or getting interrupted by the server’s follow-up in a middle of a conversation. As users, we wanted
                    to give them a space to plan their orders and not put a lot of effort into payment.
                <p>
                    To proceed, we must make a product that allows a person(s) to pre-order food, tell their dietary
                    needs, see the restaurant's current menu, and have the ability to make payments online or onsite. At
                    the same time, calculate for a group or one person. The goal I wanted to reach was finding a
                    solution to have users not have to repeat the process of updating information before heading over to
                    a restaurant and making sure that people could adjust their orders without affecting the
                    restaurant’s flow.

                <h2>Understanding our potential users better</h2>

                <p>
                    For the interview, we met with six people who had experience working in a restaurant and dined out
                    often. We learned From the conversations that the service needed to be balanced; either the server
                    came too often, making them uncomfortable, or lacking interaction for long periods. People also felt
                    uncomfortable with spitting the bill. If they worked in the restaurant and had to handle organizing
                    the tables, it took work to use paper or the technology needed to work how they needed to.

                <h2>Wirframing</h2>

                <p>
                    With the information from the interview, I built the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y_u0Dh6_qFHEKQkGr7z1rT8m0oMM4zDT/view?usp=sharing"> persona of Ashley</a>, a young
                    professional who
                    travels a lot and does not eat meat. She finds making phone reservations a hassle and needs help
                    deciding what to eat. Learning more about the user's desires, I made a list with the stakeholders to
                    find what the users need and what the company would like on the app. From that list, I started
                    sketching ideas for the site regarding dietary needs, how the menu will look for the restaurants,
                    and pre-ordering. I wanted to make sure that the users could customize and provide as much
               d the users making their account and reservation.
                </p>     information as possible to the restaurant in advance. Wroked on a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CNyiEuBiOwlufeLWpqG7WqtjNfk5G8Fj/view?usp=sharing"> mid fiedtly prototypes</a>  for the backend of the resturant an

                <p>
                    With the information that we gathered and created personas, we used that information to start
                    thinking about the layout of pages and how the user will navigate when onboarding, making payments,
                    and reserving a spot at the restaurant. This is an application that I have been assisting. I had to
                    organize and construct the mockups and wireframes and build about 55 pages. The stakeholders wanted
                    the web application to have a similar feel to Foodler, GrubHub, and Domino websites and mobile
                    applications.

                <h2>Outcome </h2>
                <p>
                    I started to code the log-in, sign-up, and onboarding process. I was also researching the back end
                    of the restaurants that would be using Chowdown. I acknowledge that the restaurants will need
                    features and hands-on while dealing with orders inside and outside the restaurant. I also learned
                    that Chowdown needed to include live order methods for users in the restaurant to request a server
                    and place their own orders.
