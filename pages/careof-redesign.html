                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Ink Tank is a web application that allows tattoo lovers to look for tattoos, share their tattoos,
                    schedule sessions or consultations with a tattoo designer, or develop a project for a new tattoo.
                    This project was from a UX project with Career Foundry.
                </p>
                <h2>The problem</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of steps to get a good tattoo. Looking for a tattoo design and finding a capable
                    tattoo artist feels like a loop, jump, and tumble. One must direct message or email, send documents
                    of what you want to do, then go to another app to make an appointment, and if the artist allows you
                    to pay digitally -- you have to go through another app to make a deposit payment. What I mean to say
                    about this process is there are ma ny steps to accomplish. That is about five to seven steps a user
                    will have to and in different methods. At least that was my experience with three of my tattoos.
</p>
                    <p>
                        A user needs to discover various tattoos for inspiration and find a capable artist to produce
                        their
                        design. To do so, a user needs a place where people can publish pieces of a tattoo design,
                        categorize the tattoo style, and connect the artist who did the work, encouraging people to
                        interact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I wanted to compress the process into one space. Ink Tank aims to share and
                        find
                        tattoo inspirations and find artists who can design, organize assignments, and organize
                        appointments.
                    </p>

                    I research mobile apps that focus on sharing and displaying content, organizing communication, and
                    scheduling an appointment for the tattoo industry. Conducting a competitive analysis allows me to
                    see what is out there for people, how easy it is for people who have experience getting a tattoo and
                    are entirely new to the process. Tattoodo and Tattoomap were indirect competitors for Ink Tank.
                    Those sites were the best indirect competitors due to some features accessible for finding an
                    artist, displaying a post, communicating with another user, and visual proof on licensed tattoo
                    artist compare to a regular user. By identifying the underserved opportunities in the market, I made
                    possible solutions to fill the users' needs.

                <article>
                    I sent out user surveys and User Interviews; I understand how people organize their projects. The
                    user’s preference enjoys setting up an appointment, looking up ideas, and hiring a professional. I
                    interviewed five users that fit close to the market Ink Tank is reaching. With the data that I
                    analyze, I did learn that users want a place where they can communicate during the build of a design
                    and view profiles and pieces of work. I have built personas for the ideal user and scenarios with
                    the information from the interviews and surveys. Creating the personas and scenarios will see the
                    user’s perspective on how Ink Tank will function within their life.

                <article>I did have difficulty finding a tattoo artist who was willing to talk to me about the tool and
                    methods they use to promote their work, organize appointments and payments. Initially, the goal was
                    to go to some tattoo shops and observe an artist during the day and see their habits. Even though I
                    was unable to observe and interview professional tattoo artists, it allowed me to focus on the
                    client-side of the app.

                <article>
                    I started to code the log-in, sign-up, and onboarding process. I was also researching the back end
                    of the restaurants that would be using Chowdown. I acknowledge that the restaurants will need
                    features and hands-on while dealing with orders inside and outside the restaurant. I also learned
                    that Chowdown needed to include live order methods for users in the restaurant to request a server
                    and place their own orders.

                    From the data provided from understanding the user, I built a couple of personas, William and
                    Danielle. To show how Ink Tank benedicts user’s day-to-day lives, I offered scenarios.

                I am making the scenarios to show how Ink Tank can benedict users day-to-day lives. Now that there is a
                better understanding of the users, I created a user flow that shows how a person navigates throughout
                the app.

                <h2> Ideate </h2>
                I created the sitemap with the user flow. To update the sitemap from a user perspective, I decided to do
                card sorting to see what users think where content will be organized. It was interesting to see the
                diverse mindset when it comes to going to specific pages and content.
                <h2> Prototype </h2>
                <article>
                    After sketching a low-fidelity prototype, I tested it out with a couple of users to see if the flow
                    was clear enough for them to get to the features. I analyze the feedback and update the sketch and
                    flow from the majority of call-outs. Once I felt satisfied with what was on paper turned the design
                    into a high-fidelity prototype and tested it again with some users.
