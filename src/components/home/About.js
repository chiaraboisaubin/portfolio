            <p> A designer by day and a developer during a full moon - making user interaction and experience better one step at a time.</p>

           <p> 
             I admire human behavior when it comes to their interaction with technology.
              Learning from people's experience and making solutions Learning from people's 
              experience and making solutions drives me to design intuitive user experience while being authentic and creative. 
              My background in Front End Development and Digital Design inform my views to improve accessibility issues with designs and development. 
              I enjoy building wireframes and prototypes, conducting usability testing, and architecting user flows. 
              I have a passion in healthcare,  E-commerce, and education. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I have experience designing and developing for E-commerce and education industries where I specialized in user accessibility, conducting A/B testing,
           content management, and developing marketing campaigns on websites and emails. After my last role, I want to design meaningful designs. 
          My talents include information architecture, wireframing, mockups, interaction design, prototyping, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
          I value collaboration and inclusion, and bring a user-focused growth mindset to work every day.
